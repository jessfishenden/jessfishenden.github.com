SUMMARY:A Night at the Cinema in 1914
DESCRIPTION:Screening as part of Leeds Free Cinema Week…\nAs the Picture House turns 100 we would like to invite you to don your formal attire and join us to experience a night at the cinema 1914 style. This marvellous programme\, compiled by the BFI National Archive\, recreates the glorious miscellany of comedies\, dramas\, travelogues and newsreels which would have constituted a typical night out in 1914. We’ve also invited the wonderful After Hours Quintet to join us for some pre-film entertainment to add to the celebrations as we reflect thankfully on the last 100 years while looking eagerly toward to the next 100.\n\nCountries:    UK\nDirector:    Various\nRunning Time:    85 mins\n\nShowing:\n    Fri 7th Nov\, 2014\, 19:00 @ Hyde Park Picture House - FREE \nTickets: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/a-night-at-the-cinema-in-1914-tickets-13433733659\n\nhttp://www.leedsfilm.com/films/night-cinema-1914/

SUMMARY:A Masque of Madness (Notes on Film 06-B\, Monologue 02)
DESCRIPTION:A Masque of Madness (Notes on Film 06-B\, Monologue 02) is a surreal experiment that takes clips from over 50 years of Boris Karloff movies and compresses them all into a single feature length film\, seeing Karloff portray over 170 different characters. The result is a schizophrenic horror journey in which Karloff often appears to be having conversations with different versions of himself. At some times Frankenstein’s Monster\, at others Jeckyll and Hyde or even some of his more bizarre roles\, the scenes are expertly cut together by Pfaffenbichler to create rhythmically repetitive set pieces which punctuate the film.\n\nCountries: Austria\nDirector:    Norbert Pfaffenbichler\nYear:    2014\nRunning Time:    80 mins\n\nShowing:\n    Fri 7th Nov\, 2014\, 21:00 @ Leeds Town Hall - Albert Room\n    Wed 12th Nov\, 2014\, 19:00 @ Leeds Town Hall - Albert Room\n\nhttp://www.leedsfilm.com/films/masque-madness-notes-film-06b-monologue-02/

SUMMARY:Alasdair Gray: A Life in Progress
DESCRIPTION:A Life in Progress is a playful documentary tribute to the unique Scottish renaissance man\, Alasdair Gray: groundbreaking novelist\, mural painter\, notorious drunkard\, irascible interviewee and controversial essayist. Filmed over the course of 15 years\, the film explores the biographical and literary influences behind his great novel Lanark and the development of his artwork from early book illustrations to the Oran Mor Arts Centre’s 21st century Sistine Chapel. The character who emerges is by turns incisive\, chaotic and laugh out loud funny and an outspoken advocate of Scottish independence.\n\nCountries:    UK\nDirector:    Kevin Cameron\nYear:    2013\nRunning Time:    94 mins\n\nShowing:\n    Fri 14th Nov\, 2014\, 17:00 @ Leeds Town Hall - Albert Room\n    Mon 17th Nov\, 2014\, 19:00 @ Leeds Town Hall - Albert Room\n\nhttp://www.leedsfilm.com/films/alasdair-gray-life-progress/

SUMMARY:1991: The Year Punk Broke
DESCRIPTION:The Sex Pistols gave the pop establishment a tremendous\, galvanising shake-up in the late 70s\, but it wasn’t until 1991 that guitar wielding revolutionaries Nirvana and Sonic Youth changed the pop landscape forever. 1991: The Year Punk Broke catches both groups at their most passionate\, just as they reach their explosive peak on a European tour. There are also mighty appearances from Dinosaur Jr. Babes in Toyland and the Ramones\, and treasured footage showing Kurt Cobain enjoying Nirvana’s early success. A glorious time capsule of a very special moment in alternative music.\n\nCountries: USA\nDirector: Dave Markey\nYear: 1992\nRunning Time: 99 mins\n\nhttp://www.leedsfilm.com/films/1991-year-punk-broke/
